# StockSimulator
Stock exchange simulator made in Swing using Java with logic backend in C++ giving it faster load time and better data control

## Features

This program implements features avaliable from my [older stock simulator written in C++ which is also avaliable as second git repository](https://github.com/DusanTodorovic5/StockPriceSimulatorCpp)
It also implements new features like :
 - Zoom on stock
 - Drag graph view
 - Draw indicator by preferred option (Close, Open, Low or High)
 - User can specify data range, from 5 seconds to 3 months.

## How to run

### Windows

User can compile java files and add .dll libraries to the project
In order to compile libraries written in C/C++ you will have to add [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)

### Linux and Mac OS 

User must recompile native libraries written in C++.
It needs only recompiling, with additional dependencies being [cURL](https://curl.se/) which is preinstalled in Linux and Mac OS and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
