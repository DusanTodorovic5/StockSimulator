# StockSimulator
Stock exchange simulator made in Swing using Java with logic backend in C++ giving it faster load time and better data control

This program implements features avaliable from my [second git repository](https://github.com/DusanTodorovic5/StockPriceSimulatorCpp)
It also implements new features like :
 - Zoom on stock
 - Drag graph view

 - User can specify data range, from 5 seconds to 3 months.

## How to run

### Windows

User can compile java files and add .dll libraries to the project
